          "Sem joined us as an intern on a project where he could work as a full stack developer.",
          "He turned out to be a very nice and incredibly driven and motivated student who needed to be slowed down rather than stimulated.",
          "He is good at turning functional ideas into technical designs, mock-ups and proof-of-concept setups.",
          "He is also very good at putting himself in the shoes of the end users of the software. This not only creates a technically well-functioning system, but also a system with a pleasant user interface.",
          "In addition, during a project there are always unforeseen situations that are more difficult to solve. Sem is someone who in such a situation certainly does not give up, but instead looks for alternatives.",
          "All in all a very good addition to our IT department."
